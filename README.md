# Retro Quickscope Simulator
**Retro Quickscope Simulator** aka **MLG Quickscoper** is a *rail shooter* (or *on-rails shooter*) HTML5 game made with [Construct 2](https://www.construct.net/en) in 2014.

You can test the game by uploading [exported files](https://github.com/szymmirr/retro-quickscope-simulator/releases) on a server or by running it on localhost, eg. with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pl/index.html). Optionally just run it straight from Construct.
