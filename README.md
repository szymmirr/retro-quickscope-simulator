# Retro Quickscope Simulator
**Retro Quickscope Simulator** aka **MLG Quickscoper** is an HTML5 game made with [Construct 2](https://www.construct.net/en) in 2014.

You can test the game by uploading [exported files](https://github.com/szymmirr/retro-quickscope-simulator/releases) on a server or by running it on localhost, eg. with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pl/index.html).

No idea why the game over screen is visible all time, I tested it with 2014 version of Firefox and nothing changed.
